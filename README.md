This is a tool used to help exploit poorly designed authentication systems by locating ASCII strings that when MD5 hashed, result in raw bytes that could change SQL logic.

## How It Works

When constructing SQL queries for authentication, if a prepared statement is not used - a user can perform a SQL injection attack. For example:

```php
$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '$_POST["email"]'"
```

This becomes complicated though when user input is hashed, such as in the case of a password:

```php
$email = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST["email"]);
$pass = md5($_POST["pass"], true);
$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '$email' AND password_hash = '$pass'";
```

Here, the `$email` field is sanitized and prevents injection. But while the `$pass` value is not directly editable by the user, two fatal flaws exist:

1. The `md5()` function is using the parameter `raw_output = true`. This results in `$pass` being raw bytes instead of a string containing a hex encoded representation of the hash.
2. The query still is not using prepared statements for that parameter.

This results in the raw bytes of the `MD5(pass)` to be interpolated into the string, leaving PHP to determine encoding conversion.

HasherBasher attacks this directly. It attempts to brute force strings who's `MD5()` raw result would encode to a string that would include a SQL injection to bypass authentication used by the query above.

For example:

Given the string, `DyrhGOYP0vxI2DtH8y`, you could calculate an MD5 hash of `6c0e97fda5c225276f522735b381a25b`. But when used with `raw_output = true`, that looks like this:

```
[108 14 151 253 165 194 37 39 111 82 39 53 179 129 162 91]
```

In the middle of those bytes are the following:

```
39 111 82 39 53
'   o  R  '  5
```

So when you submit `$_POST['pass']` with the value of `DyrhGOYP0vxI2DtH8y`, the query above ends up with the following logic:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '$email' AND password_hash = '...' OR '5'
```

Which evaluates to `true` for the where condition, so as long as an `email` of a valid user, you can login as that user.

## Features

**Incredibly fast.** Hasherbasher is generally able to brute around 5-10 million hashes per second on standard laptops. It's speed comes from three primary sources:

1. Golang's optimized compiler and crypto library
2. Parallelism via a worker pool and goroutines
3. Matching has been implemented as a finite state machine

So instead of incurring the overhead of regular expressions, it's able to locate matches orders of magnitude faster.

Effectively, the matching pattern used is:

```regex
\A.*?'(\|\||or|Or|OR|oR)'[1-9]+?.*\z
```
